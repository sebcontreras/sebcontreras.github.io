                Using TypeScript I created a tool that allows users to upload an
                image and highlight points of interest/disinterest on said
                image. When the user presses the output button, a JSON file is
                produced which holds the coordinates of each annotation relative
                to the image.
                <br /><br />
                This project was completed with one goal in mind: to dip my toes
                into image recognition software; a topic that I have always been
                fascinated with. My interest in this topic sparked when I
                listened to
                <a
                  href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/22/860884062/recaptcha-and-duolingo-luis-von-ahn"
                  >this podcast about the founder of reCAPTCHA</a
                >. Beyond stopping the rise of bots on the internet, it was
                eventually used to digitize millions of articles, aid in modern
                image recognition, and much more. I strongly recommend that
                podcast episode if you are at all interested in image
                recognition. <br /><br />
                Anyways, at the time of working on this project I did not have
                any experience with machine learning. Hence the manual selection
                of objects on the image. Now that I have taken a course on
                neural networks, I think it would be interesting to revisit this
                project and apply some automation. Take the demo above showing a
                dashboard camera as an example. By training a model with a
                traffic signal dataset, we could automatically detect common
                traffic signals such as stop signs or red lights. This would
                allow the user of the application to focus more on unique points
                of interest (POI) on the image. We could even take this a step
                further and allow the user to label their POIs, and then use
                this information to build our own datasets on common traffic
                POIs. Google has used a similar technique (via making users fill
                out reCAPTCHAs) to aid in their image recognition software.
                Pretty cool if you ask me!
                <br /><br />
                This was one of the first big(ish) individual projects that I
                worked on, and it shows! Simply put, the code is a mess. I would
                be lost trying to explain it to you. That being said, it was a
                big accomplishment for me at the time. Building something that
                works and having it be available for everyone to see on the
                internet is a pretty cool feeling. It's even cooler to look back
                on this project and see how much I've grown and improved since
                then. Maybe I'll revisit this one day.

                Worked remotely with two classmates to design and implement an

                tank level of a commuter vehicle over a 10-minute period was
