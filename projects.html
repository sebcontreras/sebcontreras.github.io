                The best way to explain this project is by first describing the
                incident that inspired it.
                <br /><br />
                A few years ago I was conversing in the car with some friends,
                when I was suddenly reminded of a meme I had seen on Instagram.
                The meme was hilarious and more importantly it tied in perfectly
                with the conversation we were having. I had to find it. I pulled
                up Instagram and began my search. Although this post was only
                from a few days ago, the <b>unchronological timeline, limited
                search functionality and overwhelming amount of content</b> rendered
                my search futile.
                <br /><br />
                The struggle to find specific posts on a social media platform
                is of course, largely by design. It’s something I like to call
                the “IKEA Model”. To illustrate my point, imagine you are
                shopping for a bed at IKEA. You walk into the store and follow
                the only path available through the the retail displays. On the
                way to the bedroom section, you walk through kitchens, living
                rooms, dining halls and workspaces. It’s not long until the
                intrusive thoughts kick in: “Ooh that’s a nice table, maybe I’ll
                get that as well”, “this rug would look great in the living
                room”. By the time you’ve made it to the beds, you’ve already
                accumulated an entire shopping list worth of IKEA furniture.
                Maybe you’ve even forgotten why you came to IKEA in the first
                place.

                IKEA and Instagram follow the same design principle of being
                inefficient by design. On route to finding that one post you
                came for, the algorithm bombards you with dozens of posts that
                it knows you’ll like. <b>These companies don’t value your time,
                they value your attention.</b>
                <br /><br />
                Fast forward to a couple of months later. I had learned a bit
                about web development and as a result I found it amusing to use
                `<i>Inspect Element</i>` on websites to see how they are built. Around
                the same time I had also become fascinated by image recognition
                software (see my `Image Recognition Tool` project below for more
                on this). These two new interests would collide one evening when
                I performed inspect element on an Instagram post and saw the
                following under the '<i>alt text</i>' of the image:
                <br /><br />
                <em
                  >"This photo may contain text that says 'US OPEN' 2 people,
                  outdoors, tennis, Serena Williams"</em
                >
                <br /><br />
                Woah. It appeared as though Instagram had used automated image
                recognition software to decipher the contents of the image
                (<i>check out </i><a>this article to find out why</a>). Something clicked.
                Could I use this information to build my own advanced Instagram
                search engine? At this moment, Instasearch was born. Here’s how
                it works:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <b>Open the ‘Instasearch' Node.js app</b> and remotely log into your
                    Instagram account.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Type in some key words</b> related to the post that you are
                    attempting to find (eg. soccer, field, ball, outdoors, ‘when
                    you’re trying to…’), as well as the page name (eg. complex,
                    babyyodamemes, serenawilliams).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Press enter and wait for Instasearch to do its thing.</b> In the
                    background, it is using a headless Chrome browser controlled by
                    Puppeteer API to scroll through the provided Instagram page. In
                    less than a minute, it’s able to scroll through over 100 posts,
                    retrieving the ‘alt text’ of each image.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Once complete, Instasearch will return the links</b> and ‘alt
                    text’ of the posts with the most keyword matches.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>If at this point if you still haven’t found the post</b> that
                    you’re after, you can increase the search count, add more
                    keywords or try a different account.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                Now let’s talk about some of the shortcomings of this project:
                <ul>
                  <li>For starter’s this project falls under the legal grey area of
                  ’web scrapping’. For this reason, I have decided it would be
                  unwise to publish this project. However, if you would like a
                  demo of this project or a peep into the code, I would be happy
                  to give you a tour.
                  </li>
                  <li>Modern image recognition software is incredibly powerful (see
                  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision">Google Vision AI</a>).
                  However, it’s also incredibly expensive to process a large
                  number of images. For this reason, Meta has chosen to go with a
                  very simple image recognition system. This system is excellent
                  at reading text from an image, but it struggles to detect
                  objects and finer details. This limits the search capabilities
                  of this application.
                  </li>
                  <li>If you are wondering why I don’t run each image through a
                  superior third part image recognition software, there are two
                  main reasons. The first is that each image could take up to
                  several minutes to process. This means that a simple 100 post
                  search could take hours. The second reason is cost. As
                  previously mentioned, this software is expensive and not meant
                  for mass image processing.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                That’s Instasearch, my humble effort at fighting back against
                the evils of the algorithm. I am very proud of this project. For
                me, it marked the first time I used my programming skills to
                solve a problem that I had. This was not an assignment or a
                resume booster, it was a passion project. Something that I would
                work on every couple of months, each time returning with more
                refined skills and an equal hatred of social media.

                A Capstone project is a right of passage for any software
                engineering graduate. For my capstone project, I was very
                fortunate to collaborate with 5 of my close friends on a project
                for our sponsor, TripSpark Technologies.
                <br /><br />
                The premise of the problem that our capstone project solved is
                this. GPS data is difficult to understand. For TripSpark, GPS
                data is a core component of their transportation software
                solutions. Many of their customers, such as public transit,
                rideshare and NEMT, have in-vehicle solutions that depend on GPS
                data for location-based features. Any of these features can have
                bugs that are caused by poor GPS data, however, they are
                difficult to troubleshoot, understand and reproduce. To help
                TripSpark solve problems that they face when handling GPS data,
                a solution was proposed to be developed as a Capstone design
                project.
                <br /><br />
                The solution aimed to improve troubleshooting GPS-related bugs
                and issues by providing TripSpark with <b>an application to
                visualize GPS data and simulate vehicle movement in the field.</b> A
                data visualization and replay tool will decrease the amount of
                time spent troubleshooting, reproducing GPS related bugs and
                testing or validating location based software. Not only will the
                application be used for TripSpark’s software developers, it can
                also be used by TripSpark’s customer care agents or deployment
                specialists to explain GPS behavior and phenomenon to clients or
                to help them improve their fleet’s GPS reception by better
                analyzing GPS data.
                <br /><br />
                Unlike many other Capstone projects that are inherited from
                previous years groups or handed off partially completed by a
                sponsor, our project was to be planned, designed, built and
                tested from the ground up in just 7 months. This was a huge
                undertaking for our small development team that was also
                juggling several other final year courses. I am proud to say
                that we were able to complete the project, delivering on all
                aforementioned features and much more. The tool is currently
                being used by TripSpark employees to assist in their everyday
                work.
                <br /><br />
                To complete this project as gracefully as we did, a lot of
                planning took place. We set our team up with interim milestones
                based on feature dependency and importance. We went through
                several design and redesign phases based on shifting project
                requirements and uncovered platform limitations. We followed an
                agile development process, partaking in sprints and dividing
                large tasks into actionable tickets. We designed the project
                architecture, adhering to object-oriented design principles and
                a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm">Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern.</a> We made mockups,
                following UX design principles and sponsor feedback to achieve
                the optimal end-user experience. We went through strenuous code
                reviews and design meetings to ensure our code not only worked,
                but was optimal. We did a whole lot, and more importantly we did
                it well.
                <br /><br />
                Although I could not have done this project on my own, I must
                now talk about my personal contributions. This is, after all, a
                personal portfolio. I will list what I believe were my two biggest 
                contributions to this project:
                <h4>1. Creative solutions</h4>
                I believe that one of the biggest assets I brought to this
                project is my <b>open-minded and creative approach to problem
                solving.</b> This is hard to quantify, so I will attempt to do so by
                giving an example.
                <br /><br />
                Early on in the project, we decided that upon clicking on a data
                point on the map, a popup should appear displaying the
                information of that point. This would enable the to user to
                quickly glance at information along the vehicle route, without
                having to scroll to that point in the timeline. This was a great
                idea because correlating the scrollable timeline to a physical
                point on the map isn’t always that intuitive. This is specially
                true when the vehicle is moving in a route that overlaps several
                times over (which is common for many of TripSpark’s transit
                clients). But what if the user did want to move that point in
                the timeline? What if this specific area was a point of interest
                for them, and they wanted to resume playback from that point in
                time. Upon considering this use case, I suggested the idea that
                a double-click on a point should move playback to said point.
                The group along with the sponsor agreed that this would be very
                useful.
                <br /><br />
                Reality (which for developers consists of the chosen platform)
                can often be disappointing. Due to MAUI’s multi-platform
                capabilities, double-click is not an actionable event. When this
                was discovered during a design meeting, we tried and failed to
                come up with a workaround. We had no choice but to scrap the
                double-click feature. This would be disappointing for the
                sponsor as this was one of the features we had promised, but
                there is only so much that us as developers can do when bounded
                by technological limitations. We had to move on with the meeting
                and the project.
                <br /><br />
                As the meeting went on however, I could not stop thinking about
                this conundrum. I thought back to how excited TripSpark was when
                we mentioned this feature. Although this feature fell squarely
                into the “nice-to-have” category, it’s usefulness was not lost
                on me. These types of features are what take an application from
                good to great.
                <br /><br />
                I took a step back and tried to look at the “bigger picture”. I
                think that as developers its really easy to get stuck with
                “tunnel vision” which forces us to focus on the wrong problem.
                <b>We end up trying to fix the solution, instead of focusing on the
                root problem.</b> The goal was not to double-click, the goal was to
                navigate to a point on the map. This distinction is important.
                After some thought, I proposed an alternative to the group. To
                add a button on the popup itself to navigate to that point.
                Ultimately and to the delight of our sponsor, this was solution
                that I ended up implementing. A slight change in perspective is
                what took an idea from the chopping block to production.
                <br /><br />
                Although this solution may appear as being trivial in hindsight,
                its the path to getting to a trivial solution that is often the
                complicated bit. It requires us to be creative, to “think
                outside the box”, to widen our perspective and narrow our
                intention. I attribute many of my career and creative
                accomplishments (including this project) to my competence in
                this skill.
                <br /><br />
                <h4>2. Mr. Playback</h4>
                One key feature of this application was the ability to simulate
                real-time GPS playback. Let me explain what that means. Our
                application takes in raw GPS data in an NMEA file format (raw
                text). This data then needs to be processed and converted into
                useable GPS data points containing information such as
                coordinates, time, vehicle speed, etc. Once these data points
                are created we can do two things: plot the vehicle route on the
                map and <b>playback the vehicle position in real-time.</b> The latter
                was one of my main tasks throughout this project; eventually
                earning me the name, Mr. Playback.
                <br /><br />
                To accomplish this task, I created a service within our
                application exclusively for playing back through the data
                points. I used the timestamps on each data point to iterate
                through the data in chronological order. Each time the playback
                service would reach a new point, an event would be emitted
                indicating the vehicle’s new position. This event was then
                captured on the front-end of the application, where an event
                listener would use the new information to animate a vehicle icon
                to its new position. This gave the appearance of the vehicle
                moving along the screen.
                <br /><br />
                Additionally, this same “new position” event could be captured
                by a separate simulation service. This service could output the
                data to a socket, simulating data coming in from a live GPS
                module. This functionality <b>enabled our application to be used as
                a GPS simulation source.</b>
                <br /><br />
                The real headache with the playback service was in integrating
                it alongside many of our other features. For example, the
                vehicle playback could be paused, played, sped up, slowed down
                or moved to a different point in the timeline altogether. The
                playback service needed to be able to react gracefully to all
                these scenarios. This was specially tricky as many of these
                features were being built asynchronously by myself and other
                members of the team. This is where strong communication and
                agile development was crucial to our success. For instance, when
                a team member was working on the UI for playing and pausing
                playback, we collaborated to ensure that the correct events were
                being triggered on their end (frontend), so that I could make
                the playback (backend) react accordingly. Collaborations like
                this didn’t just happen by chance. They were predetermined
                during our sprint planning. Although it’s not always the most
                exciting part of our job, planning is the fuel that makes the
                development train roll.

                Using TypeScript I created a tool that allows users to <b>upload an
                image and highlight points of interest/disinterest</b> on said
                image. When the user presses the output button, a JSON file is
                produced which holds the coordinates of each annotation relative
                to the image.
                <br /><br />
                This project was completed with one goal in mind: to dip my toes
                into image recognition software; a topic that I have always been
                fascinated with. My interest in this topic sparked when I
                listened to
                <a
                  href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/22/860884062/recaptcha-and-duolingo-luis-von-ahn"
                  >this podcast about the founder of reCAPTCHA</a
                >. Beyond stopping the rise of bots on the internet, it was
                eventually used to digitize millions of articles, aid in modern
                image recognition, and much more. I strongly recommend that
                podcast episode if you are at all interested in image
                recognition. <br /><br />
                At the time of working on this project I did not have any
                experience with machine learning. Hence the manual selection of
                objects on the image. Now that I have taken a course on neural
                networks, I think it would be interesting to revisit this
                project and apply some automation. Take the demo above showing a
                dashboard camera as an example. By training a model with a
                traffic signal dataset, we could automatically detect common
                traffic signals such as stop signs or red lights. This would
                allow the user of the application to focus more on unique points
                of interest (POI) on the image. We could even take this a step
                further and allow the user to label their POIs, and then use
                this information to build our own datasets on common traffic
                POIs. Google has used a similar technique (via <a href="https://medium.com/@thenextcorner/you-are-helping-google-ai-image-recognition-b24d89372b7e">making users fill
                out reCAPTCHAs</a>) to aid in their image recognition software.
                Pretty cool if you ask me!
                <br /><br />
                This was one of the first big(ish) individual projects that I
                worked on, and it shows! Simply put, the code is a mess. I would
                be lost trying to explain it to you. That being said, it was a
                big accomplishment for me at the time. Building something that
                works and having it be available for everyone to see on the
                internet is a pretty cool feeling. It's even cooler to look back
                on this project and see how much I've grown and improved since
                then. Maybe I'll revisit this one day.

                This project was my first proper dive into <b>learning JavaScript
                and functional programming.</b> After working through the Mozilla
                JavaScript course, I wanted to apply my new skills by building a
                project.
                <br /><br />
                I chose a calculator because it was simple, while still
                providing some interesting challenges. For example, the `-` key
                must act as both a subtraction sign, and as a negative sign
                depending on the operation (e.g. multiplying a negative). Little
                nuances like this seem trivial, but it when it comes to
                implementing them yourself, they do take some thought. This
                project was full of little edge cases that forced you to write
                helper functions and implement some error handling.
                <br /><br />
                Another fun challenge with this project was to make it look
                good. I decided to style the calculator similar to the Apple
                calculator app. It was fun to play around with CSS until I got
                the result that I wanted.
                <br /><br />
                Overall, this was a <b>fun beginner project</b> that provided a lot of
                learning opportunities. I recommend it to anyone who is learning
                functional programming or web development!

                This is the worst project on this page, but arguably, my
                <b>most important.</b> <br /><br />
                As part of the first year engineering curriculum at UofC,
                everyone had to take a programming course. To many students,
                myself included, this was our first time ever writing a line of
                code. I would love to say that I was a natural and that I
                instantly knew I wanted to do this for the rest of my life. That
                was not the case however.
                <br /><br />
                I have vivid memories of sitting on the top floor of the Taylor
                Family library, metaphorically (but almost literally) banging my
                head against the keyboard attempting to get a digital ball to
                loop around the perimeter of my laptop screen. <b>Learning
                to code is hard.</b> It requires you to unlock a different way
                of thinking. I remember being frustrated but ultimately
                mesmerized when I finally got that damn ball to loop. I had done
                something. Unlike integrating a function or solving a
                derivative, the result wasn’t just a number, it was a tangible
                thing. I could have watched that ball loop for hours.
                <br /><br />
                Every Friday I would go up to the library and work on that
                week’s coding assignment. As the semester went on, I slowly but
                surely began to love programming. Sure it was hard, but boy oh
                boy was it ever rewarding. If you yourself are a programmer, I’m
                sure you know the feeling.
                <br /><br />
                As the semester came to a close it was time for the final
                project, a car dashboard. The objectives were as follows: using
                an Excel file containing the distance travelled, RPM and fuel
                tank level of a commuter vehicle over a 10-minute period, <b>build
                a car dashboard to display the speed, fuel economy and range of
                the vehicle in real-time.</b>
                <br /><br />
                Considering the rudimentary programming skills that I possessed
                at the time, this was a very daunting task. It was my first time
                processing raw data, creating a real-time simulation and
                building anything close to this scale. It required a lot of
                research, stack overflow and caffeine. I spent many hours on
                this project, but the more I worked on it, the more I enjoyed
                it. It was fun to build something from the ground up and see it
                come together before your eyes. Before long I had all of the
                base requirements completed. Most sane students at this stage
                would have submitted their project. This was first year
                engineering after all and we had four other tough courses to
                worry about. I however did the insane thing, and continued to
                work on it.
                <br /><br />
                I’m not sure what came over me. Maybe it was my love for cars or
                the lack of sleep driving me crazy, but I just wanted to make
                this project as cool as I could. I added 2 different car
                options, an odometer, a gear indicator, a compass and much more.
                I even pulled an all-nighter figuring out how to add a radio
                that let you choose between 3 different songs. Ultimately, I
                think what drove me (pun intended) to work on this project was
                that I simply enjoyed programming more than any other course.
                <br /><br />
                This revelation was not lost upon me. I think this project was
                the final nail in the coffin that convinced me to major in
                software engineering. For that reason, and that reason alone, it
                deserves a spot on this portfolio page. Sure the code is a mess.
                It violates every single object-oriented principle and is more
                confusing than a Christopher Nolan movie. And yes it was built
                in Processing which isn’t even a real programming language. But
                I don’t care about all that.
                <br /><br />
                There are few things I’ve worked on in my life that have been as
                impactful on me as this project. It steered my life (see what I
                did there?) in a wonderful direction and for that I am forever
                grateful. Thank you Car Dashboard, may your unhinged codebase
                live on forever.
