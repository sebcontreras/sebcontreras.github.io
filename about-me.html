            <p>
              I’ve always been fascinated with how things work. I find great
              satisfaction in being puzzled by a system, dismantling it,
              studying it, and in doing so, understanding it. Not all systems
              can be so trivially taken apart and studied however. After all,
              our modern world is built on millions of years of human intuition.
              Every day, people are using this ever-growing foundation to
              uncover new technologies and push society forward.
              <br /><br />
              We interface directly with these technologies everyday, but its
              rare that we ever stop and wonder how they work. Why is that? Is
              it because people don’t care? Maybe. But I think there’s a better
              explanation (or at least a more interesting one). Here it goes:
              the people who create them don’t want you to know.
              <br /><br />
              Let me explain. Scientists and engineers are not evil, they are
              just really good at what they do. They show you what you need,
              rarely bothering you with the intricacies of how or why. They are
              modern day magicians, and a good magician never reveals his
              secrets. Put the gas pump here and it’ll stop itself when the tank
              is full. Press the popcorn button and your corn will be popped to
              perfection. There is no need to confront the user with fuel
              pressure chokes or popcorn steam calculations. Life is complicated
              enough as it is. Good inventions should not make life anymore
              complicated, they should just work.
              <br /><br />
              Like magic.
              <br /><br />
              I’ve always been intrigued by this very concept. So much so that I
              decided to enroll in engineering at the
              <i>University of Calgary</i>. I wanted to understand what was
              really going on behind the smoke and mirrors, and maybe create
              some magic of my own. <br /><br />
              My interests initially lay in mechanical systems and moving parts.
              However, everything changed when I took a programming course and
              waved <em>std::cout << “Hello World!”;</em> for the first time.
              <br /><br />
              I quickly discovered a new world full of interesting problems and
              even more interesting solutions. Beyond being interesting, these
              new problems were real. How do we store, process, encrypt and send
              data? How do we design an interface so intuitive that it doesn’t
              require an instruction manual to operate?
              <br /><br />
              By solving these types of problems, I learned that software
              empowers society. It enables doctors to diagnose, teachers to
              engage their students, families to communicate and so much more.
              <br /><br />
              As my understanding of software grew, so did my passion. I was
              sold. Five years later I’m proud to say I graduated with a degree
              in Software Engineering.
              <br /><br />
              During my degree I had the privilege to intern at a variety of
              software companies. I got to go behind the scenes and learn how
              software is built and maintained at an industry level. I got to
              apply my skills and make a tangible impact. I finally got to
              transform my curiosity into action, and action into results. I
              learned the beautiful and incredibly human satisfaction in
              applying your skills to make someone’s day even just a little
              better. I learned that <b>there is no magic</b>. Magic is simply
              well executed abstraction, done by dedicated individuals.
              <br /><br />
              As I look ahead towards my future, there are many uncertainties.
              There are, however, some things I do know for certain. I will
              continue to learn and remain curious. I will uphold my
              responsibility to use my education and skills not for personal
              gain, but to leave a positive impact on the world.
              <br /><br />
              If this at all resonated with you,
              <a href="contact.html">let's chat</a>. Maybe we can make some
              magic together. <br /><br />
