                    The process of preparing for coding interviews is anxiety-inducing
                    for many developers. There’s so much material to cover, and often
                    much of it feels irrelevant to what devs are doing in their day
                    jobs, which only adds to the stress. One of the outcomes of this is
                    that it’s now common for developers to spend weeks combing through
                    hundreds of interview questions on sites like LeetCode. One of the
                    most common points of anxiety developers that I’ve talked to have
                    before the interview is: Have I solved enough practice questions?
                    Could I have done more? That’s why I try to focus on helping
                    developers grasp the underlyingpatterns behind each question — so
                    they don’t have to worry about solving hundreds of problems and
                    suffer from Leetcode fatigue. If you understand the generic
                    patterns, you can use them as a template to solve a myriad of other
                    problems with slight variations.
